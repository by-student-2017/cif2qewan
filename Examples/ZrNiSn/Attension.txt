Currently, "primitive cell" is not able to fit the Wannier function well. 
Although the "conventional cell" fits the Wannier function well, 
it should be noted that the band dispersion in the "primitive cell" often seen in papers cannot be drawn. 
I think there is no problem with calculating DOS or other physical properties. 
If calculation cannot be performed using "primitive cells", 
the advantage of speeding up will be greatly reduced.
